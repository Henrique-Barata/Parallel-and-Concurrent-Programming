# Parallel-and-Concurrent-Programming

This repository, "Parallel-and-Concurrent-Programming," showcases various projects that explore parallel and concurrent programming techniques across multicore, GPU, and distributed systems. The primary focus of the projects is to address complex, multi-tasked environments, emphasizing efficient coding practices to achieve high performance. The repository includes projects that deal with parallel execution, synchronization mechanisms, dynamic load balancing, and advanced programming models such as Actor and Map-Reduce.

This repository highlights my expertise in parallel computing across different platforms. The projects are written mainly in Java (91%), with significant use of CUDA (5.3%) for GPU programming, as well as small contributions in Python (2%) and Shell (1.7%). This diverse language composition reflects the range of technologies and tools used to tackle different aspects of parallel programming.

The use of Java in the majority of the projects demonstrates my proficiency with the language in implementing robust, scalable solutions. In particular, my experience with synchronization and dynamic load balancing techniques in multicore and distributed systems highlights my understanding of critical challenges in parallel execution. CUDA, used in some projects, enables me to leverage the GPUâ€™s parallel processing power to optimize computation-heavy tasks. Python, although used less frequently, is employed in some scripts for automation and testing, while Shell scripting is used for system-level operations and orchestration.

The projects within the repository not only showcase advanced techniques but also demonstrate my ability to adapt and apply various parallel programming models, such as the Actor Model and Map-Reduce. These models are essential for solving problems in distributed systems, where tasks are executed concurrently across multiple nodes or processes. Through these projects, I aim to demonstrate how these models can be implemented efficiently to achieve optimal performance in real-world applications.

In summary, this repository is a culmination of my work in parallel and concurrent programming, reflecting my dedication to mastering complex systems and optimizing performance. Each project exemplifies my ability to think critically about system design, implement scalable solutions, and explore innovative techniques in parallel computing.
